# PGP - Computer Security
The goal of the project is a better understanding of the PGP scheme for the protection of e-mail, as well as the possibilities it provides and how to use it. 
For this purpose, the project involves the design and implementation of an application with a graphical user interface in the `Python` programming language, 
which should enable the following functionalities: 
- Generation of a new and deletion of an existing pair of keys 
- Import and export of a public or private key in `.pem` format 
- Display of public and private keyrings with all the necessary information 
- Sending a message (with encryption and signing) 
- Receiving a message (with decryption and verification)
